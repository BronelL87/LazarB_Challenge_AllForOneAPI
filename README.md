#   Challenge - All For One API

**Name**: Bronel Lazar

**Date**: 1/13/2025

**Description**: Created an API that has all the endpoints needed for the All For One based on prior assignments, each with their own controller and service file

### Peer Review

**Reviewer** David Monterrosa


**Reviewer Notes** Overall the endpoints seem to work with the exception of restaurant picker, where there seems to be an issue with your data validation.
